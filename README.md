- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fakefloordiv
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in network programming, especially web-technologies
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... I'm learning golang, and how to dismiss this GitHub's default template.

Currently I'm working on my own http-parser+webserver. This is a thing I'm doing since early 2021. And gonna do until 2026. I'd even say that it's currently my main stirring life.
IDK what else I'm supposed to write here
